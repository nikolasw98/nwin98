									<h1>About Me<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Hello, and welcome to my developer portfolio! On the main page of this website are a few projects from<br />
									coding courses and programs I am developing for fun. Please feel free to message me through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolas-win/">LinkedIn</a> 
									or to contact me through email if you have any questions!

								<p>As a recent graduate of San Jose State University (<a href="https://www.sjsu.edu/">SJSU</a>) with a B.S. in Business Administration, Finance, I was converted to a Junior Accountant 
								at the EHR SaaS company,<a href="https://www.drchrono.com/">DrChrono</a>, I interned for throughout my junior and senior years at SJSU. After DrChrono was acquired by EverCommerce (EVCM), 
								a SaaS corporation, at the end of 2021, I was promoted to a GL Staff Accountant position on the corporate accounting team in January, 2022. While I was at EverCommerce, it was apparent 
								the ability to code was becoming more valuable, not only from an employer's perspective, but also from a working professional's. Since the ability to code enables an employee to work on a 
								broader range of cross-functional projects, I decided to enroll in a SQL course at the UCLA Extension for the Winter 2022 quarter. The SQL course peaked my interest in coding and motivated me 
								to enroll a Python Programming 1 course at the UCLA Extension for the following quarter (Spring 2022).</p>
								<p>Last month, I decided to leave my GL Staff Accountant position to pursue a role at an insurance brokerage (<a href="http://www.singlepointins.com/">Singlepoint Insurance Services, Inc.</a>) 
								that provides risk consulting services to some of California's largest private employers and public entities. This decision was motivated by my desire to work on projects using big data analytics
								and machine learning that stemmed from the aforementioned programming courses, and initiated my career in consulting. Now, my end goal is to help clients improve their financial performance, 
								sustainability, longevity, and environmental/social impact by developing new data analytical tools and models, all of which would not be possible without the ability to code!
